# =========================================================
# 🛠 DEVELOPMENT NOTES (Sonu)
# =========================================================
# 📌 In development, some files like `.env` should NOT be ignored so all teammates can use the same variables.
# 📌 Anything generated automatically (logs, build outputs, node_modules) stays ignored.
